# Hello World ðŸ¤“

### My name is Luis and I'm a highschooler in Arkansas.

I'm currently self learning python _**(and I suck)**_, but I want to get better and expand horizon to other languages like java.  
I want to learn how to code in two languages because I know how to speak in two languages.ðŸ—£  
I'm currently learning the basics, but I'm also trying to jump into doing personilized projects.  
As of right now, I'm trying to get my worlde game to be properly color cordinated.    
I got an interview at *ASMSA* and I'm debating about going if I'm accepted.ðŸ¤”
